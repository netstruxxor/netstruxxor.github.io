        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 26, 2026</p>

        <p>
            These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Foksel application and related materials
            (the “Service”) provided by Netstruxxor LLC (“Netstruxxor”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
            By installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel is intended for use by organizations and professionals responsible for identity and access management.
            By using the Service, you represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of your organization and to
            accept these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
            You agree to use the Service only in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and your organization’s
            internal policies. You will not:
        </p>
        <ul class="hero-points">
            <li>Use the Service to violate privacy, security, or access control policies.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code except where permitted by law.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to infringe intellectual property or other rights of any party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Accounts and credentials</h2>
        <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any credentials, configuration, or access used to
            operate Foksel within your environment. Netstruxxor is not responsible for unauthorized access resulting from
            misconfigured systems, weak credentials, or compromised accounts.
        </p>

        <h2>4. No guarantee of outcome</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel is designed to assist with identity and access management workflows, but final responsibility for
            account lifecycle, approvals, and compliance remains with your organization. The Service is provided as a
            tool; it does not replace your policies, oversight, or audits.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Updates and changes</h2>
        <p>
            We may update or modify the Service from time to time, including bug fixes, improvements, or new features.
            We may also update these Terms. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes
            acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-party systems</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel may interact with third-party systems (such as directories, ticketing tools, or HR systems) as
            configured by your organization. Netstruxxor is not responsible for the availability, security, or behavior
            of third-party systems.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
        <p>
            The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied,
            or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, Netstruxxor shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
            consequential, special, or punitive damages, or for any loss of data, business, or profits, arising out of
            or related to your use of the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you materially violate these Terms or use the
            Service in a way that could harm Netstruxxor, other users, or third parties. Your organization may also
            terminate use of the Service at any time by uninstalling and ceasing all use.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Governing law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Netstruxxor LLC is organized, without
            regard to conflict of law principles.
        </p>
