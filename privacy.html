        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 26, 2026</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how Netstruxxor LLC (“Netstruxxor”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
            and protects information in connection with the Foksel application and related materials
            (collectively, the “Service”).
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel is designed as an enterprise-focused identity and access management tool. The application itself
            does not collect personal information for marketing or resale. Any data processed by Foksel is controlled
            by the organization that deploys and operates it (“Customer”).
        </p>
        <ul class="hero-points">
            <li><strong>Configuration data:</strong> Settings, policies, and environment-specific configuration values.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational data:</strong> Logs, audit trails, and workflow outputs generated during normal use.</li>
            <li><strong>Support data:</strong> Information you choose to provide when contacting us for support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How information is used</h2>
        <p>
            Information processed by Foksel is used solely to provide identity and access management functionality,
            including account creation, updates, deprovisioning, and related workflows. Netstruxxor does not use
            Customer data for advertising, profiling, or unrelated analytics.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data ownership and control</h2>
        <p>
            All data processed by Foksel within a Customer environment is owned and controlled by that Customer.
            Netstruxxor does not access Customer environments unless explicitly authorized for support or troubleshooting.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Storage and retention</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel operates within the Customer’s infrastructure. Data storage, backup, and retention policies are
            determined by the Customer’s own IT and compliance requirements. Netstruxxor does not dictate or manage
            retention of Customer data.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel is designed with enterprise security practices in mind, including clear audit trails and deterministic
            workflows. However, the security of the environment in which Foksel runs (operating system, network, access
            controls) is the responsibility of the Customer.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel may interact with directory services, ticketing systems, or other enterprise tools as configured by
            the Customer. Any data exchange with third-party systems is governed by the Customer’s own agreements with
            those providers.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Foksel is an enterprise tool and is not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect information
            from children under 13 years of age.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at
            the top of this page. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of
            the revised Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Contact</h2>
        <p>
            If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or Foksel, you may contact Netstruxxor LLC using the contact
            information provided in the Microsoft Store listing or on our website.
