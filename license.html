        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 26, 2026</p>

        <p>
            This Software License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (an individual or entity)
            and Netstruxxor LLC (“Netstruxxor”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) governing your use of the Foksel software
            (the “Software”).
        </p>

        <h2>1. License grant</h2>
        <p>
            Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and payment of any applicable fees, Netstruxxor grants you a
            limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the Software solely for your internal
            business purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
        <ul class="hero-points">
            <li>Sell, rent, lease, sublicense, or distribute the Software to third parties.</li>
            <li>Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Software, except as expressly permitted.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except where permitted by applicable law.</li>
            <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on or within the Software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Ownership</h2>
        <p>
            The Software is licensed, not sold. Netstruxxor and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in
            and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Evaluation or trial use</h2>
        <p>
            If the Software is provided on an evaluation or trial basis, your license is limited to the evaluation period
            communicated to you. At the end of the evaluation period, you must cease use of the Software or obtain a
            valid license.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Updates</h2>
        <p>
            Netstruxxor may provide updates, patches, or new versions of the Software. Unless accompanied by a separate

        </p>

        <h2>6. Support</h2>
        <p>
            Any support services for the Software, if provided, are governed by separate terms or agreements. Netstruxxor
            is not obligated to provide support unless explicitly agreed.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
        <p>
            The Software is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied,
            or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, Netstruxxor shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
            consequential, special, or punitive damages, or for any loss of data, business, or profits, arising out of
            or related to your use of or inability to use the Software, even if advised of the possibility of such
            damages.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            This Agreement is effective until terminated. It will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any
            term of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies in
            your possession or control.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Export compliance</h2>

            your use of the Software.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Governing law</h2>
        <p>
            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Netstruxxor LLC is organized, without
            regard to conflict of law principles.
